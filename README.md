# CSC384---Picross-Solver

Picross (nonogram) solver made as final project for the discipline of CSC384 (Artificial Intelligence) of the  University of Toronto. 

Able to solve monochromatic and multi-layered multi-coloured picrosses*. See examples for more information on how to inputting boards to be solved.

Python version used: 3.4.3
To execute use: 
	A)To get a PNM image as output for a sample color puzzle use: (NOTE: most viewers dont open PNM images)
	-python3 Picross_sample_color.py
	B)To get a monochormatic picross solution on the command line use: (NOTE: two characters are used to represent each square of the board.
	-python3 Picross_sample_pb.py 

*The rules for this approach are not the same as for the usual multi-coloured picrosses you find.
